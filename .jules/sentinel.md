## 2026-02-12 - Authorization Bypass via Path Traversal Logic
**Vulnerability:** The authentication middleware used `!normalizedPath.endsWith('/login')` to exclude the login endpoint from protection. This logic is flawed because it inadvertently unprotects any path ending in `/login` (e.g., `/api/admin/users/login`), allowing potential authorization bypass if such endpoints are created.
**Learning:** Avoid using loose string matching like `endsWith` for security exclusions. Path normalization and strict equality checks are crucial to prevent unintended exposure of resources.
**Prevention:** Always use strict equality (`===`) or a strict allowlist for public endpoints in authentication middleware. Do not rely on pattern matching that can be manipulated by URL construction.
