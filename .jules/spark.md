## Staggered List Animations
- **Learning:** Applying `transition-delay` via inline styles on an element that also has `transition-all` (e.g., for hover effects) causes the hover effect to be delayed as well.
- **Solution:** Use a CSS variable (e.g., `--enter-delay`) for the delay value in the inline style, and then apply `transition-delay: var(--enter-delay)` strictly within the `.v-enter-active` (or `.list-enter-active`) CSS class. This ensures the delay only applies during the entrance animation.

## Lockfiles
- **Learning:** Be careful not to commit large lockfiles (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) if they were not present before, especially when the task requires small changes.
